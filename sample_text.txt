This is a sample text file for testing the tokenizer training script.
It contains multiple sentences with various words and punctuation.
The tokenizer should be able to handle different types of text, including URLs like https://example.com, email addresses like user@example.com, and numbers like 123.45.
Special tokens such as [PAD], [UNK], [BOS], [EOS], [SEP], and [MASK] are handled automatically by the tokenizer.
This sample demonstrates both BPE (Byte Pair Encoding) and WordPiece tokenization methods.
Users can configure parameters like vocabulary size, minimum token frequency, and text normalization options.
